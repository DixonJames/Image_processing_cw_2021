window:
    A) have 2 lines of same gradient with slightly differing y intercepts. put image on the 'graph' and for ech row of
        the image find the pixel that best matches where the line would go though on the graph
    B) for each row between these lines have a full intensity of given overlay. respectively to the R/L of each of
        the R/L most lines have a Gaussian distribution drop off that gradually reduces the intensity of the overlay
    C) where the overlay is present, for each RGB channel will take a proportion of each depending on parameters
        input into filter (and also depending on the Gaussian distribution on the edges)

    D) also, as we should have another light dispersion dependant on the height of the light. should have most intense mean
        roughly in the center and have each row getting away from the get darker. probably use a larger sigma than use
        laterally as should only really just be noticeable (look at DUO examples for reference when fine tuning.)

        
rainbow:
    main difference to regular light here is the spectrum of colours.
    instead of having natural light colour across every row, will instead run though the spectrum along the row.
    will run though a function that will take an input of the length of pixels it has to go though the spectrum in
